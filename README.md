# DNA-LDPC-codes

This repository is the implementation of *Reducing Costs in DNA Data Storage Using Soft Information-based Decoding from Variable Length Reads* (S.-J Park *et al.* (2022))


Thanks to libraries we used in this work..


* ***LDPC***: Library for encoding and decoding are used. It is available in https://github.com/radfordneal/LDPC-codes.  
* ***FLASH***: Library for merging paried-end reads from next-generation sequencing experiments. It is available in http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH/.  
* ***MUSCLE***: Library for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm. It is available in https://github.com/rcedgar/muscle.
