Align FASTA input, write aligned FASTA (AFA) output:
    muscle -align input.fa -output aln.afa

Align large input using Super5 algorithm if -align is too expensive,
typically needed with more than a few hundred sequences:
    muscle -super5 input.fa -output aln.afa

Single replicate alignment:
    muscle -align input.fa -perm PERM -perturb SEED -output aln.afa
    muscle -super5 input.fa -perm PERM -perturb SEED -output aln.afa
        PERM is guide tree permutation none, abc, acb, bca (default none).
        SEED is perturbation seed 0, 1, 2... (default 0 = don't perturb).

Ensemble of replicate alignments, output in Ensemble FASTA (EFA) format,
EFA has one aligned FASTA for each replicate with header line "<PERM.SEED":
    muscle -align input.fa -stratified -output stratified_ensemble.efa
    muscle -align input.fa -diversified -output diversified_ensemble.afa

    -replicates N
        Number of replicates, defaults 4, 100, 100 for stratified,
          diversified, resampled. With -stratified there is one
          replicate per guide tree permutation, total is 4 x N.

Generate resampled ensemble from existing ensemble by sampling columns
with replacement:
    muscle -resample ensemble.efa -output resampled.efa

    -maxgapfract F
       Maximum fraction of gaps in a column (F=0..1, default 0.5).

    -minconf CC
       Minimum column confidence (CC=0..1, default 0.5).

If ensemble output filename has @, then one FASTA file is generated
for each replicate where @ is replaced by perm.s, otherwise all replicates
are written to one EFA file.

Calculate disperson of an ensemble:
    muscle -disperse ensemble.efa

Extract replicate with highest total CC (diversified input recommended):
    muscle -maxcc ensemble.efa -output maxcc.afa

Extract aligned FASTA files from EFA file:
    muscle -efa_explode ensemble.efa

Convert FASTA to EFA, input has one filename per line:
    muscle -fa2efa filenames.txt -output ensemble.efa

Update ensemble by adding two sequences of digits to each replicate, digits
are column confidence (CC) values, e.g. "73" means CC=0.73, "++" is CC=1.0:
    muscle -addconfseqs ensemble.efa -output ensemble_cc.efa

Calculate letter confidence (LC) values, -ref specifies the alignment to
compare against the ensemble (e.g. from -maxcc), output is in aligned
FASTA format with LC values 0, 1 ... 9 instead of letters:
    muscle -letterconf ensemble.efa -ref aln.afa -output letterconf.afa

    -html aln.html
        Alignment colored by LC in HTML format.

    -jalview aln.features
        Jalview feature file with LC values and colors.
